<div class="lessonbox" id="3lesson1box1">
	<!--Stage 3 - Lesson 1 Content-->
	<h3 class="lessonsubheading">What is OOP</h3>
			 	
		<div class="nano_des">
		<p>OOP Stand for <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> and Object is a Thing and Thing Can Be 
		any Thing Like a Laptop Which is an Object and The Brand <em>Acer</em> is the Class of an Ojecct.</p>
		<p>Object's Like <b>Lego Bricks</b> Which is Package of Functions ,Libray Which We Can Reuse Over and Over in Our Code.</p>
		<p>Object Oriented Object's are an Idea's that Form into <em>Abstraction</em> and Let Start Defining the Laptop into OOP Concept</p>
		<p>OOP Start with Class Which is the Blueprint of Creating Something.</p>
		<p>Class is the Label Which You Want to Label Like a Gaming Laptop, Slim-Laptop and Businee Laptop.</p>
		<P>We Have a Laptop Which is Acer and We Put the Acer Laptop in a <span class="listspan">acer class</span> than We Have another Laptop Called HP and We Put it in <span class="listspan">HP class</span> and We Have a Acer Mobile and We Will Put the Acer Mobile in the <span class="listspan">acer Class</span> and This is Where <em>OOP</em> Get Started Because We are Not Creating a 2 Diffrenct Class for a Same Brand But Difference Like a Laptop and Mobile</p>
		<p>For Example</p>
		<!--Function Block of CODE-->
 			<div class="boxcode">
 				<p>Classes: These are Same Brands Classes<br>
 				<span class="intendcode">acer = Acer Laptop</span><br>
 				<span class="intendcode">Acer Mobile</span><br>
 				<br>
 				<span class="intendcode">hp = HP Laptop</span><br>
 			</div>
 		<p>We are Using the Same <span class="listspan">acer Class</span> for Both the Laptop and Mobile Becuase are the Same Brand - THis is Called Inheritance.
 		<p>Inheritance is That You are Inheriting Some From Above Which Mean a Super Class and acer is our Brand Super Class for Acer Prodcuts.</p>
		<p>
		<p>The Fundamentals Concepts of OOP include Class, Object, Methd, Abstraction,etc.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<!--Stage 3 - Lesson 1 Content-->
<div class="lessonbox" id="3lesson1box2">
		<h3 class="lessonsubheading">OOP Vocabulary</h3>

		<div class="nano_des">
		<p>In Non-OOP Programming You Will Keep Code and Data Different and They are Not Connected</p>
		<!--Function Block of CODE-->
			<div class="boxcode">
 				<p>Units of Code = Functions</p><br>
 				<p>Units of Data = Sructures</p>
 			</div>
 		<p>This is How the Case is in OOP Because Code and Data is Merge in to One Thing Which is an Object</p>
 		<p>This is Where Abstraction Take Place Because We Don't Know What is Happing Behind the Scence , if We Try to Break the Object than Out Software Will Be Break</p>
 		<p>In the Acer Object Which is the Object of Laptop Object Class and If We Try to Muniplate that Objects in a <em>Standard Library</em> and Try Look the Hidden Code Which Shouldn't We Be Looking than Our Software Will Break.
 		<p>A Class Can Be Define also as Feature's of an Object Like an Car</p>
 		<p>Feature's of an Car Can Include:
 			<!--Function Block of CODE-->
			<div class="boxcode">
 				<p>Attributes</p>
 				<span class="intendcode">= Properties</span>

 				<p>Behaviors</p>
 				<span class="intendcode">= Methods</span>
 			</div>
 		<p>Attributes Can Given to an CAR</p>
 		<!--Function Block of CODE-->
			<div class="boxcode">

		<p>Object is an <span class="listspan">instance</span> of an <b>Class</b></p>
		<p>A <span class="listspan">Method</span> is an Behavior of Class Like an CAR Example Above and With in a Program a <span class="listspan">Method</span> Affects One Object</p>
		<p><span class="listspan">Inheritance</span> or You Call Sub-Class of an Super Class Which is Parent Class, Like Toyota and Suzuki will have the Same <span class="listspan">Class car</span> Which They Will Inhertit from.</p>
		<p><span class="listspan">Abstraction</span>is Hard to Understand But it is an Practice of Reducing Details and Focus On One or Fews Concepts at a Time</p> 
		<p><span class="listspan">Module</span> is a Hidden Box from Us But We Interacts with it When Want to import Some Function But We Really Don't Know What Happing the Box (Module) But Modules are Classes Which are Boxes to Store the Methods and Attributes</P>
		<p><span class="listspan">Library</span> Stores the Module's Which Have the Functions We Don't Need But When We Need Than We Have to Revoke the Funtion by the importing the Library in Which it Have the Function Like <span class="listspan">webbrower</span> is Library which have a Very Usefull Function<span class="listspan">def open()</span> which is Use to open a link in the Web Browser</p>
		<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/">Python Standard Library</a> is the Gold Mine of Functions But Why We Don't Have all the Functions in the Built-in Library of Python So We Don't Have to Import and The Answer is the Speed and Memory Because We Only import the Library Which We Want to Use Which Keeep the Memory in Low Uasge and Performance of the Python Script Fasters.</p>
		<p>HTML ID Which Can Be Use Only One is Not an Object Which We Created and It Can Be Use Only Ones But HTML Class is an True Object In a Sense We Can Use it Multiple Times and Control it Via CSS</p>
		<p>Reusing the Class Attribute Give as an Edge to Control the Code and Reuse When Ever We Like in Our HTML Dcoument</p>
